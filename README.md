# Code Detective
Code Detective is a software plagiarism detection tool based on MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity) method of Stanford University. It is written in C++ and designed with QT Creator. Contributions made by Osman Araz and Muhammet Çeneli, respect to their 1<sup>st</sup> graduation project of Yıdız Technical University - Computer Engineering department.

## What Code Detective Can Do?
Code Detective detects plagiarisms in seconds for programming source codes such as C, C++, C#, Java and Pyhton and for documents such as TXT and PDF. Code Detective checks plagiarisms for files that given by the user, it doesn't search over internet to check plagiarims.

Code Detective extracts and processes syntaxes of C source codes. Therefore all of the variable names will be same, such as function names will be same, loop types will be same, conditional statement types will be same etc. For other source code types, there is no syntax processing for the current version of Code Detective.
