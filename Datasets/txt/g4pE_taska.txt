Object oriented programming is a  style of programming that supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Inheritance means derived  a new class from the base class.  We can also say there are parents class and child classes in inheritance.  Inheritance was firstly derived in 1967.
The child class has all the features of parents class or we can say the base class more over it may also include some additional features.  Inheritance is used for modification and implementation new features in computer programming language.It is possible that child class has all the attributes of parents class but it is not possible that all the attributes of child class must have in base class or parent class.
I categorization in computer language also inheritance is a useful tool.categorization define as a powerful  feature.it  has been also used in generalisation and in human learning. In some areas less information need to be stored.
Generlisation also some time known as inheritance. The main reason behind this is a hierarchi structure of objects and classes. We can understand  this mechanism by some examples: like fruit is aq main class and mangoes apple ,orange is child classs of the main class.So obviously inherit all the properties of fruit class.
