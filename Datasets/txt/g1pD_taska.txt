Inheritance is a method of forming new classes using predefined classes. The new classes are called derived classes and they inherit the behaviours and attributes of the base classes. It was intended to allow existing code to be used again with minimal or no alteration. It also offers support for representation by categorization in computer languages; this is a powerful mechanism of information processing, vital to human learning by means of generalization and cognitive economy. Inheritance is occasionally referred to as generalization due to the fact that is-a relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects. Inheritance has the advantage of reducing the complexity of a program since modules with very similar interfaces can share lots of code. Due to this, inheritance has another view called polymorphism, where many sections of code are being controlled by some shared control code. Inheritance is normally achieved by overriding one or more methods exposed by ancestor, or by creating new methods on top of those exposed by an ancestor. Inheritance has a variety of uses. Each different use focuses on different properties, for example the external behaviour of objects, internal structure of an object, inheritance hierarchy structure, or software engineering properties of inheritance. Occasionally it is advantageous to differentiate between these uses, as it is not necessarily noticeable from context.
