In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a way to form new classes
(instances of which are called objects) using classes that have already
been defined.

Inheritance is also sometimes called generalization, because the is-a
relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects. For
instance, a "fruit" is a generalization of "apple", "orange", "mango"
and many others. One can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple,
orange, etc. Conversely, since apples are fruit (i.e., an apple is-a
fruit), apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all
ruit, such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant.

Inheritance is typically accomplished either by overriding (replacing)
one or more methods exposed by ancestor, or by adding new methods to
those exposed by an ancestor.
