Using the vector space model for Information Retrieval models all pages
and queries as high-dimensional sparse vectors. Each item in the vector
represents a different keyword.

The similiarity betweeen two pages or a query and a page can be computed
using the dot product formula to find the cosine between them. This
represents the angle between them, but in n-dimensional space. Results
will range from -1 to 1, with 1 being a close match. Normally the vectors
will not have any negative values, so results will always be greater than
or equal to 0. The cosine is computed using: cos A = (|a||b|)/(a.b)
