The representation of a set of documents as vectors in a common vector space is known as the vector space vector space model and is fundamental to a host of information retrieval (IR) operations including scoring documents on a query, document classification, and document clustering.We first develop the basic ideas underlying vector space scoring; a pivotal step in this development is the view of queries as vectors in the same vector space as the document collection.
